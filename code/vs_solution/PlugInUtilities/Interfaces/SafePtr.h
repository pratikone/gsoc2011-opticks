/**
 * Smart pointer used to automatically NULLify when the subject is deleted.
 *
 * This class handles a number of issues relating to the management of
 * Subject attachment lifetimes:
 *   - Detaching from the Subject upon destruction.
 *   - Detecting when the Subject is deleted to prevent stale pointers.
 *
 * This class is intended to be used as a member variable, in place of a raw
 * pointer to the Subject.  If subclasses are to be allowed to attach
 * to the Subject, the variable should be made protected.
 *
 * Note that this class will not cause any kind of callback when
 * its Subject has been deleted.  It will simply NULLify the pointer.
 * If you require any special handling for when the Subject has been deleted,
 * You should separately attach to SIGNAL_NAME(Subject, Deleted).
