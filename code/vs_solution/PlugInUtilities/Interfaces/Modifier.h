/**
 *  Tracks modifications to an object.
 *
 *  This class stores a modified flag that can be set with setModified() and
 *  queried with isModified().  The modified() signal is emitted whenever
 *  setModified() is called with a value of \c true.  The attachSignal() method
 *  can be called to setup a signal/slot connection where the setModified()
 *  method is called whenever the given signal is emitted.
 *
 *  This class can be used to track modifications in two ways:
 *  -# An object can subclass this class to store a modification state and to
 *     provide a common modified() signal that can be automatically emitted
 *     when other GUI widgets are modified.
 *  -# This class can be created by an object to track modifications of another
 *     object that does not track its own modifications.
