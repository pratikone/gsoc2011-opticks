/**
 *  Base class for all undo actions added to the undo stack in a view.
 *
 *  This class can be subclassed to create custom undo actions that will be
 *  executed when the user clicks the Undo or Redo toolbar buttons.  Subclasses
 *  must override the executeUndo() and executeRedo() methods to perform the
 *  undo or redo.  The inherited QUndoCommand::undo() and QUndoCommand::redo()
 *  method obligations are implemented in this class to emit signals before and
 *  after the undo or redo is performed and to change the mouse cursor to a
 *  wait cursor while the undo or redo is performed.
 *
 *  Since undo actions typically perform operations on a SessionItem, an
 *  UndoAction optionally stores a session item by its ID and provides the
 *  getSessionItem() accessor method as a convenience to retrieve the
 *  SessionItem pointer when performing the undo or redo.  Since the stored
 *  session item may be deleted when performing the undo or redo, the
 *  sessionItemChanged() signal is provided to notify the application that the
 *  session item ID of other actions may need to be updated.
