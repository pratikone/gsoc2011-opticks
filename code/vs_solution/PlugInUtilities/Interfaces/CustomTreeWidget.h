/**
 *  A tree view widget with in-cell editing capbilities.
 *
 *  The CustomTreeWidget extends the QTreeWidget class to provide in-cell
 *  editing to allow the user to change the value of a particular cell.  The
 *  following edit capabilities are provided:
 *
 *  <pre>
 *  Edit Capability     Description
 *  ==================  =======================================================
 *  None                The cell cannot be edited by the user.
 *  Check Box           The cell contains a check box that the user can toggle
 *                      on and off.  %Text can optionally be displayed next to
 *                      the check box.
 *  Color               The cell contains a colored pixmap indicating the
 *                      selected color for the cell.  %Text can optionally be
 *                      displayed next to the colored pixmap.
 *  Line Edit           A single-line edit is invoked for the user to enter
 *                      text when the user activates the cell.
 *  Custom Line Edit    A single-line edit is invoked for the user to enter
 *                      text when the user activates the cell.  Enhancements
 *                      or restrictions may be placed on the line edit such as
 *                      a custom alignment or echo mode, or a validator or
 *                      completer by creating a QLineEdit independently from
 *                      the tree widget and calling the setCustomLineEdit()
 *                      method.
 *  File Browser        A single-line edit box with a browse button is invoked
 *                      when the user activates the cell.  When the user clicks
 *                      the browse button, a file selection dialog is invoked
 *                      for the user to select a single file.
 *  Directory Browser   A single-line edit box with a browse button is invoked
 *                      when the user activates the cell.  When the user clicks
 *                      the browse button, a file selection dialog is invoked
 *                      for the user to select a directory.
 *  Shortcut Edit       A single-line edit box is invoked when the user
 *                      activates the cell.  As the user types, the keystrokes
 *                      are converted into key combinations that displayed in
 *                      the edit box.  Examples of key combinations include
 *                      "Ctrl+S", and "Shift+F5".
 *  Combo Box           A drop-down combo box is invoked when the user
 *                      activates the cell.  The combo box items are populated
 *                      by creating a QComboBox indepentently from the tree
 *                      widget and calling the setComboBox() method.
 *  Spin Box            A spin box is invoked when the user activates the cell.
 *                      The step size and range of values in the spin box are
 *                      set by creating a QSpinBox independently from the tree
 *                      widget and calling the setSpinBox() method.
 *  Double Spin Box     A double precision floating-point spin box is invoked when
 *                      the user activates the cell.  The step size and range of values
 *                      in the spin box are set by creating a QDoubleSpinBox independently
 *                      from the tree widget and calling the setDoubleSpinBox() method.
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  The default row height of tree widget items that are added to a custom tree
 *  widget is 20 pixels to provide additional room for an edit widget.
 *
 *  Each item can be drawn with horizontal gridlines, vertical gridlines, or
 *  both.
