/**
 *  This is the basic template that underlies all of the Resource capability.
 *
 * The Resource template is effectively an auto_ptr with a trait describing how to obtain and release
 * the resource. The default trait is MemoryObject, which results in identical syntax and functionality
 * to an auto_ptr. It can also be used to manage FILE *, objects and vectors created via the Object
 * Factory and spectral elements created via ModelServices. The following examples show creation
 * (and upon exit from the code block - destruction) of each of these types.
 * 
 * @code
 * {
 *    // Allocate a PassThru object from the heap. The PassThru object will be deleted on destruction of the Resource
 *    Resource<struct PassThru> pMyObject;
 *    Resource<struct PassThru> pMyObject2(new PassThru); // alternate syntax to the above line
 *
 *    // Open a file for reading. On destruction of the FileResource, the file will be closed
 *    Resource<FILE,FileObject> pMyFile(FileObject::Args("e:\\application\\configure.in", "r"));
 *    FileResource pMyFile2(FileObject::Args("e:\\application\\configure", "r")); // alternate syntax to the above line
 *    FileResource pMyFile3("e:\\application\\configure.out", "r"); // alternate syntax to the above line
 * 
 *    // Create a Filename object via the ObjectFactory. On destruction of the FactoryResource, the 
 *    // object will be destroyed via the ObjectFactory.
 *    Resource<Filename,FactoryObject> pMyFilename(FactoryArgs("Filename"));
 *    FactoryResource<Filename> pMyFilename2(); // alternate syntax to the above line
 * 
 *    // Create an empty vector of Filename objects via the ObjectFactory.
 *    Resource<vector<Filename*>,FactoryVector> pMyVector(FactoryArgs("Filename"));
 * 
 *    // Create a DataElement via ModelServices. On destruction of the ModelResource, the 
 *    // object will be destroyed via ModelServices.
 *    ModelResource<AoiElement> pMyAoi2("MyAoi", mpRasterElement);
 * } // closes all 3 files and deletes the Filename, vector, AOI, and PassThru objects
 * @endcode
 *
 * Additional traits can be defined as needed. The requirements for a traits class are as follows.
 * 1) It must have a default constructor
 * 2) It must define a nested struct/class/typedef called Args
 * 3) It must define a method called obtainResource taking an Args object as its only non-default argument and
 *     returning a value that can be cast to a (T*). If this call fails, the obtainResource method should throw an
 *     exception to prevent the creation of an invalid Resource object.
 * 4) It must define a method called releaseResource taking an Args object and a T* as its only non-default arguments
 * The only requirement on the nested 'Args' struct/class is that it have a copy constructor.
 *
 *  @param   T
 *           The type of the object the Resource wraps
 *  @param   SourceTrait
 *           The type of object to use for obtaining and releasing objects of type T
