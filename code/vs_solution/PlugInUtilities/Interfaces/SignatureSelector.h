/**
 *  A dialog to import and select signatures.
 *
 *  The signature selector is a dialog that allows users to select one or more
 *  signatures from a list.  The dialog displays a list of signatures containing
 *  all Signature objects currently loaded into the data model. The user has the
 *  option of creating one or more filters that will reduce the number of
 *  signatures displayed in the list.  Filters can be created based on any
 *  combination of the following signature attributes:
 *  - %Signature Name
 *  - Metadata Attribute Name
 *  - Metadata Attribute Value
 *
 *  When creating the filter, wildcarding and case sensitivity options can be
 *  set separately on each of the filter criteria listed above.  The filter can
 *  also be applied to signature libraries as a whole, or to the individual
 *  signatures contained within the library.
 *
 *  If the user does not find the desired signature(s) in the list, an Import
 *  button is provided for the user to import one or more signatures while the
 *  dialog remains active.
 *
 *  When the user clicks the Import button, the dialog is expanded to contain a
 *  separate list of signature files from which the user can select one or more
 *  signatures to import.  After import, the main signature list is updated
 *  appropriately.
 *
 *  On signature import, the user can browse the disk for one or more signature
 *  files in a single directory or the user can search one or more directories
 *  for recognized signature files.
 *
 *  When a single signature in the main signature list is selected, the user can
 *  view the signature's properties by clicking on the %Properties button in the
 *  dialog.
 *
 *  By default, the dialog contains OK and Cancel buttons.  For modeless
 *  instantiations of the dialog an Apply button can be added by setting the
 *  appropriate parameter in the constructor.  When the dialog contains an Apply
 *  button, it can be enabled and disabled by calling enableApplyButton().  A
 *  custom button can also be added to the dialog by passing the button text
 *  into the constructor.  When the dialog contains a custom button, it can be
 *  enabled and displayed by calling enableCustomButton().
