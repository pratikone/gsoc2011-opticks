/**
 *  \ingroup ShellModule
 *  A base class for plug-ins with modeless dialogs.
 *
 *  This class contains functionality to properly destroy modeless
 *  dialogs in a plug-in.  The default functionality of the class
 *  sets the destroy after execute flag to false so that the modeless
 *  dialog will not be destroyed when execute() successfully returns
 *  and the allow multiple instances flag to false so that only one
 *  modeless widget is available at any time.
 *
 *  The abort() method is used to register a PlugInCallback with
 *  DesktopServices to destroy the viewer widget.  Derived plug-in
 *  classes should therefore provide an implementation for the
 *  getWidget() method to return a pointer to the modeless dialog or
 *  other viewer widget.
 *
 *  Derived plug-in classes must call the abort() method when the
 *  executable should be destroyed.
 *  This typically occurs in an overridden QWidget::closeEvent()
 *  method in the modeless dialog or when the executable has detected an error
 *  and needs to close.
