 *    - Hdf5CustomWriter::setDataToWrite() is called
 *      and if false is returned, the Hdf5CustomWriter
 *      instance is deleted.
 *    - Hdf5CustomWriter::getWriteFileType(),
 *      Hdf5CustomWriter::getWriteMemoryType() and
 *      Hdf5CustomWriter::createDataSpace() are called in
 *      any order.
 *    - Hdf5CustomWriter::getWriteBuffer() is called.
 *    - The Hdf5CustomWriter instance is deleted.
