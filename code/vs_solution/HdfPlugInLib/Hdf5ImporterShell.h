 * \ingroup ShellModule
 * The base class of an importer that loads data in HDF Version 5 format.
 *
 * The HDF5 Importer Shell is a class designed to wrap the HDF5 libraries and
 * provide a convenient means of importing simple (header, metadata, 1 cube)
 * HDF5 data. The shell class is highly customizable, but to use
 * these features requires downloading the HDF5 v1.6.2 precompiled libraries
 * from <A HREF=ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/prev-releases/hdf5-1.6.5/bin/>*</A>
 * or <A HREF=ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/hdf5-1.6.5/bin/>*</A>.
 *
 * To link a derived plug-in under Windows, define _HDF5USEDLL_ and link to hdf5dll.lib.
 * To link a derived plug-in under Solaris, define _HDF5USEDLL_ and link to libhdf5.so.0.0.0.
