 *  Settings, characteristics, and features for docking windows.
 *
 *  This class defines all of the services available to dock windows.  A dock
 *  window can attach to an edge of the main application window,or can float
 *  independently on the desktop.  When the user right-clicks in the window's
 *  context, a \ref contextmenus "context menu" is invoked allowing the user to
 *  change the display characteristics of the window.  The window also contains
 *  a button to hide itself.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *  - The following methods are called: dock(), undock(), show(), and hide().
 *  - The user right-clicks in the window to invoke a context menu.
 *  - Everything documented in ViewWindow.
