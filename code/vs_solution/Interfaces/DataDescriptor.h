/**
 *  Describes a data element.
 *
 *  A data descriptor contains all ancillary data for a DataElement that is
 *  not part of the raw data.  ModelServices stores elements based on a key
 *  that is comprised of a name, type, and parent element, which are all stored
 *  here.  For this reason, the data descriptor must be created by calling
 *  ModelServices::createDataDescriptor() passing in the name, type, and parent
 *  element.
 *
 *  After the data descriptor is created the name, type, and parent element
 *  cannot be set directly on the data descriptor object to preserve the
 *  integrity of the identifying key in ModelServices.  After the data
 *  descriptor is created call ModelServices::setElementName() to change the
 *  name and ModelServices::setElementParent() to change the parent.
 *
 *  The data descriptor also contains the element classification and metadata,
 *  a processing location value that indicates how the data was imported and
 *  where it is accessed, and a FileDescriptor indicating how the data is
 *  stored in a file on disk.
 *
 *  The file descriptor is intended to indicate how a data element was imported
 *  and therefore is typically set only by importers and not as a result of
 *  creating a new data element or exporting an existing data element. The file
 *  descriptor is owned by the data descriptor class.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *  - The following methods are called: setClassification(), setMetadata(),
 *    setProcessingLocation(), and setFileDescriptor().
 *  - The descriptor is renamed.
 *  - All notifications documented in Subject.
 *
