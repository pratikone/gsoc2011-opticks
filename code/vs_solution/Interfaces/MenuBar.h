/**
 *  Container for menus with user executable commands.
 *
 *  This class provides access to the menu structure from which users can
 *  execute a variety of actions.  Plug-ins can use the menu bar to actively
 *  add and organize actions.  The application contains a menu bar located at
 *  the top of the main application window that can be obtained by calling
 *  DesktopServices::getMainMenuBar().  In addition to the main menu bar, each
 *  toolbar contains a menu bar that is the first widget on the toolbar that
 *  can be obtained by calling ToolBar::getMenuBar().
 *
 *  Plug-ins should use the MenuBar class when Qt slot methods within the
 *  plug-in should be called when the command is invoked.  For this to work
 *  properly, these plug-ins should stay resident after execution.
 *
 *  There are several approaches to adding and organizing menus and commands on
 *  the menu bar.  One approach is that a menu can be added with addMenu(), and
 *  then custom actions can be added directly to the menu.  Each action that is
 *  added directly to a menu will not have a keyboard shortcut initialized from
 *  the user-defined configuration settings  If the user should be able to edit
 *  and save the keyboard shortcut, insertCommand() should be called or
 *  DesktopServices::initializeAction() should be called prior to adding the
 *  action to the menu.
 *
 *  A second approach to adding and organizing menus and commands on the menu
 *  bar is that an existing menu can be added with the insertMenu() method.
 *
 *  A third approach is that a command can be directly added to the menu bar
 *  with the addCommand() method.  There are two versions of the method, one
 *  that allows the user to edit and save a keyboard shortcut, and one that
 *  does not allow the user to edit and save a keyboard shortcut.  Both
 *  methods take a string location, which will create any menus and submenus as
 *  necessary.  This means that the menu and/or submenus do not need to be
 *  created before adding the command to the menu bar.
 *
 *  The MenuBar class should not be used by plug-ins that desire the
 *  Executable::execute() method to be called when a command is invoked.  Use
 *  the PlugInShell::setMenuLocation() and PlugInShell::addMenuLocation()
 *  methods instead, or override Executable::getMenuLocations().
