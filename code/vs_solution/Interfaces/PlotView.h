/**
 *  Displays plot objects.
 *
 *  The plot view provides the means to display one or more plot objects.  Plot
 *  objects can be added and removed from the view and can also be selected and
 *  deselected.
 *
 *  The plot view defines the following mouse modes, where the name given is the name
 *  populated by MouseMode::getName():
 *  - AnnotationMode
 *  - LocatorMode
 *  - PanMode
 *  - SelectionMode
 *  - ZoomBoxMode
 *
 *  The annotation mouse mode allows users to add annotation objects to the
 *  plot.  Objects can be added programatically via an annotation layer that is
 *  accessible by calling the getAnnotationLayer() method.
 *
 *  For the locator mouse mode, the view contains a default Locator object to display
 *  on the plot.  When this mouse mode is active, the default behavior is to display
 *  the locator when the left mouse button is pressed and to hide the locator when the
 *  left mouse button is released.  Access to the locator to change its properties is
 *  provided with the getMouseLocator() method.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *  - The following methods are called: addObject(), deleteObject(), selectObjects(),
 *    selectObject(), deleteSelectedObjects().
 *  - Everything else documented in OrthographicView.
 *
 *  @see     PlotObject
