/**
 *  A view for custom product generation.
 *
 *  The product view provides a means by which custom output products can be created.
 *  The view contains an annotation layer called the layout layer that is displayed on
 *  a sheet of paper.  Annotation objects can be added to the layout layer to create a
 *  finished product.  View objects are often used in the layout layer to display
 *  data or results.  Because views can be modified separately, the product view contains
 *  an active edit view.  The active edit view object is identified in the layout layer
 *  with selection handles.  The view also contains a classification layer to specify
 *  classification markings for the product.
 *
 *  The product view defines the following mouse modes, where the name given is the name
 *  populated by MouseMode::getName():
 *  - LayerMode
 *  - PanMode
 *  - ZoomInMode
 *  - ZoomOutMode
 *  - ZoomBoxMode
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *  - The following methods are called: setPaperSize(), setPaperColor(),
 *    setDpi(), setActiveLayer().
 *  - Everything else documented in PerspectiveView.
