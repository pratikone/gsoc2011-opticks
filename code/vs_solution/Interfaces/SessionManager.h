/**
 *  \ingroup ServiceModule
 *  Provides interfaces for saving and restoring the session and for creating
 *  a new session.
 *
 *  The session-save process is as follows:
 *  1) The session manager retrieves a pointer to each SessionItem, including:
 *    a) Data Elements
 *    b) Windows
 *    c) Views
 *    d) Layers
 *    e) PlotSets
 *    f) Plot Widgets
 *    g) Animation Controllers
 *    i) Animations
 *    j) Modules
 *    k) PlugIn Descriptors
 *    l) PlugIn instances
 *  2) The session directory is created, if necessary
 *  3) The session directory is cleared of obsolete SessionItem files
 *  4) For each SessionItem, it creates a SessionItemSerializer and calls SessionItem::serialize()
 *  5) The Session index file is written.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *  - The session is closed.
 *  - Everything else documented in Subject.
 *
 *  @see        SessionItem, SessionItemSerializer
