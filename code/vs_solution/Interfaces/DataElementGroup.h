/**
 *  Provides for associations of DataElements.

 *  A data element group stores a list of DataElements. It assumes 
 *  ownership of the elements added to it, meaning that when the group is
 *  destroyed, all elements currently contained in the group will also be
 *  destroyed.
 *
 *  If a DataElement that has been added to the group is destroyed via
 *  ModelServices, the group will be notified and will remove the element
 *  from its internal tracking. This will trigger a notification of a change to the
 *  group.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *    - An element or group of elements is added to the group
 *    - An element or group of elements is removed from the group
 *    - Other notifications documented in the DataElement and Subject classes.
