/**
 *  Classification information for data elements and views.
 *
 *  The Classification serves as an attribute for other data objects. It
 *  captures the security classification data needed to handle and mark
 *  the other data objects. There currently is no straight-forward mechanism
 *  to maintain the classification of the classification itself.
 *
 *  Most of the interface is based upon the NITF 2.1 classification attributes
 *  collection, with some modifications for flexibility or complexity reduction.
 *  Additional attributes can be added using the DynamicObject inherited interfaces.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *     - The following methods are called: setLevel(), setSystem(), setCodewords(),
 *         setFileControl(), setFileReleasing(), setDeclassificationDate(),
 *         setDeclassificationExemption(), setFileDowngrade(), setCountryCode(),
 *         setDowngradeDate(), setDescription(), setAuthority(),
 *         setAuthorityType(), setSecuritySourceDate(), setSecurityControlNumber(),
 *         setFileCopyNumber(), setFileNumberOfCopies(), setFileNumberOfCopies(),
 *         deserialize().
 *     - Everything else documented in DynamicObject.
