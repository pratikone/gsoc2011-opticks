 *  A view to display layers.
 *
 *  The spatial data view provides a means by which one or more layers are displayed.
 *  Layers that are available for display are contained in the view's layer list, which
 *  has an associated data set.  Layers for other data sets can be added to this view,
 *  which adds the layer to the layer list.  It is also possible to add all layers in
 *  another layer list to the view.  When displaying layers the view maintains a display
 *  index, which specifies the order in which the layers are drawn in the view.  For
 *  raster layers, a texture mode is available that specifies how the pixels are drawn
 *  at their boundaries.
 *
 *  The spatial data view defines the following mouse modes, where the name given is the
 *  name populated by MouseMode::getName():
 *  - LayerMode
 *  - MeasurementMode
 *  - PanMode
 *  - RotateMode
 *  - ZoomInMode
 *  - ZoomOutMode
 *  - ZoomBoxMode

 *  - The following methods are called: setLayerDisplayIndex(), setTextureMode(), 
 *    showLayer(), hideLayer(), setActiveLayer(), setFrontLayer(), setBackLayer(),
 *    bringLayerForward(), sendLayerBackward().
 *  - The display index of any layer changes.
 *  - Everything else documented in PerspectiveView.
