/**
 *  Base class for objects to send notification when their data changes
 *
 *  Generalized interface for objects that can notify observers
 *  when changes have been made. It provides a uniform means for
 *  letting other objects register an interest in the contents 
 *  of this object's contents.
 *
 *  Each %Subject has signals that it will emit under certain circumstances.
 *  When a signal is emitted, all slots attached to that signal on the %Subject
 *  will be called. For example:
 *  @code
 *  pSubject->attach(SIGNAL_NAME(Subject, Modified), Slot(pObj, &Obj::mySlot));
 *  @endcode
 *  This will cause pObj->mySlot(*pSubject, "Subject::Modified", v) to be called
 *  whenever pSubject emits SIGNAL_NAME(Subject, Modified).
 *
 *  Whenever a signal other than Subject::Modified or Subject::Deleted is
 *  emitted, Subject::Modified will also be emitted.
 *  This means that all slots attached to Subject::signalModified on a 
 *  %Subject of type MyClass will be called when that MyClass object 
 *  emits SIGNAL_NAME(MyClass, MySignal).
 *
 *  Signals for a particular instance of a %Subject can be supressed by using
 *  either the SignalBlocker or SignalEnabler classes.
 *
 *  The notification of slots is done in two passes.
 *  First, all slots attached to the specific signal are notified in FIFO
 *  order (First In == first attached, and First Out == first notified).
 *  Then, assuming the specific signal is not Subject::Deleted or
 *  Subject::Modified, all slots attached to Subject::Modified
 *  are notified in FIFO order.
