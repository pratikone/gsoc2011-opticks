   /**
    *  Creates a new session item block.
    *
    *  Typically, SessionItem data can be saved as a single block of data either with
    *  a single call to serialize() or a call to reserve() followed by multiple calls
    *  to serialize(). It may be desirable in certain cases to block the data for a single
    *  SessionItem. The first block may contain an XML header, for example, and further
    *  blocks contain raw binary data. In this case, the XML is more easily separable
    *  from the binary data and can be more easily passed to an XML parser without the
    *  raw binary data interfering or slowing down the parse.
    *
    *  A SessionItem wishing to use this feature should call serialize() once, or reserve()
    *  followed by serialize() to write the first block. When finished with the block, call
    *  endBlock() to close the block and prepare the SessionItemSerializer for the next block.
    *  Call serialize() or reserve() followed by serialize() for the second block. Repeat this
    *  for additional blocks of data. The final block will implicitly call endBlock(). 
    *
    *  @note Different blocks will not necessarily be stored adjacent to each other. Different
    *        session serialization implementations may locate blocks in different files, or in
    *        different segments of the same file. SessionItem serialization should treat different
    *        blocks as discreet items. You can not, for example, write out a data cube with each
    *        band stored in a different block and expect that the entire data cube is contiguous
    *        on the disk.
