/**
 *  A container for multiple signatures.
 *
 *  This class provides encapsulation for multiple signatures into a single object.  The
 *  SignatureLibrary is also a SignatureSet, so it can contain metadata, a description,
 *  and acquisition values.  The Signature Library's set of Signatures is largely immutable, 
 *  in that, except for an empty library, new signatures cannot be added to it, and, 
 *  for the most part, signatures cannot be removed from it.
 *
 *  When a SignatureLibrary is deleted, Signatures contained in the set are automatically
 *  deleted. It owns its signatures.
 *
 *  The primary benefit of a SignatureLibrary over a standard SignatureSet is that the
 *  SignatureLibrary can store much larger collections of signatures and can more 
 *  efficiently and conveniently resample them. Additionally, a SignatureLibrary
 *  provides faster, more convenient access to its primary ordinate data.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *  - The following methods are called: 
 *    resample(), desample(), import(), insertSignature(), insertSignatures(), clear().
 *  - Everything else documented in SignatureSet.
 *
 *  @see        SignatureSet
