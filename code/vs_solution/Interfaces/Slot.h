/**
 *  Class for specifying which method to call in response to a call to notify
 *  by a Subject.
 *
 *  Typically, only the constructors of this class will be used outside of the
 *  underlying implementation of the Subject class. 
 *
 *  When a Subject calls 'notify' with a particular signal name, all slots that
 *  are attached to that signal on the Subject will have their update method
 *  called. The slot's update method will in turn call the method on the 
 *  object provided via the slot's constructor. Slot methods need to have the
 *  following signature:
 *
 *  @code
 *  void T::method(Subject &subject, const std::string &signal, const boost::any &v);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  When called, the arguments will be as follows:
 *  subject: the Subject notifying with the signal
 *  signal: the name of the signal the Subject notified
 *  v: data provided to the notify method by the Subject
 *
 *  When a %Slot is attached to a signal on a Subject, if the slot method is on
 *  an object derived from Observer, the object's attached method will be 
 *  called. Similarly, when a %Slot is detached from an object derived from
 *  Observer, the object's detached method will be called.
 *

/**
 *  Class for specifying a signal to re-emit.

 *  Only the constructors of this class will be used outside of the

 *  that are attached to that signal on the Subject will have their update method
 *  called. The Signal's update method will in turn call notify on it's Subject
 *  using the Signal's signal name.
 *
 *  For example:
 *  @code
 *  pSubject->attach(SIGNAL_NAME(Subject, Modified), Signal(pObj, SIGNAL_NAME(Subject, Modified)));
 *  @endcode
 *  This causes pSubject->notify(SIGNAL_NAME(Subject, Modified, any)); to result in
 *  pObj->notify(SIGNAL_NAME(Subject, Modified), v) being called. Remember that NULL
 *  is a wildcard for signal names. Using NULL as the first argument to attach
 *  in the case above will cause all signals to be forwarded. Using NULL for 
 *  second argument to the Signal ctor will cause the name of the original
 *  signal to be re-used when the signal is re-emited. E.g.
 *  @code
 *  pSubject->attach(NULL, Signal(pObj, NULL));
 *  pSubject->notify("MySignal", any(myData));
 *  @endcode
