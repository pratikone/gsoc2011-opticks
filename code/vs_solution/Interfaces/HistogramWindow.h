/**
 *  A specialized plot window to display histogram plots.
 *
 *  The histogram window manages multiple histogram plots on potentially
 *  multple plot sets.  A plot set is added for each spatial data view that
 *  contains layers.  %Histogram plot widgets are automatically added to the
 *  plot set when the layer is created.  For automatically created plots, the
 *  name of the plot set is the same name as the view, and the name of the plot
 *  is the same name as the layer.  Additional plot widgets can be added to any
 *  plot set in the window, using the basic plot window functionality as
 *  desired.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
