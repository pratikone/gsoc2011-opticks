/**
 *  A three-dimensional perspective view.
 *
 *  The perspective view uses a perspective projection to draw its contents in three
 *  dimensions.  The data can be zoomed, panned, and rotated in several different
 *  fashions.  The reset() and resetOrientation() functions return the view to its
 *  original display state.  The aspect ratio is preserved in all dimensions regardless
 *  of the display configuration.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *  - The following methods are called: zoomTo(), rotateTo(), rotateBy(),
 *    zoomAboutPoint(), zoomBy(), zoomToPoint(), zoomToCenter(), flipBy(), flipTo(),
 *    flipHorizontal(), flipVertical(), resetZoom(), resetOrientation(), and reset().
 *  - The user causes the view to pan, rotate, flip, or zoom.
 *  - Everything else documented in View.
