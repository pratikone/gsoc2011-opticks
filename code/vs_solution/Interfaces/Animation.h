/**
 *  A collection of animation frame objects with a current frame.
 *
 *  An animation object provides the means by which other objects can be animated by
 *  providing a set of animation frames, one of which is identified as the current
 *  frame.  An animation by itself does not provide a lot of functionality but simply
 *  notifies attached objects when its current frame is changed.  The real work
 *  of a displaying an animation is therefore in those objects that attach to the
 *  animation object.
 *
 *  To create a useful animation, first create a class with a Slot method.  This class
 *  should contain the logic needed to prepare frames for display.  Next, create
 *  a vector of animation frames for times of interest to the animation.  Create the
 *  animation by calling AnimationController::createAnimation().  Attach the class to the
 *  animation.  Then in the class's Slot method, whenever signalFrameChanged() is the
 *  signal with a non-NULL value, this indicates that the current frame has
 *  changed.  any_cast the value to an AnimationFrame pointer and perform any
 *  specific updates based on the new frame values.
 *
 *  An animation is both created and destroyed from an animation controller.
 *
 *  This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 *    - The object is deleted.
 *    - The following methods are called: setName(), setFrames(), and
 *      setCurrentFrame().
 *    - Other notifications documented in the Subject class.
 *
 *  @see     AnimationFrame, AnimationController
