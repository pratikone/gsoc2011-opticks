Additive White Gaussian Noise reduction by Non Local Mean algorithm
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Reducing noise of additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) types by using Median filter

Algorithm
for every pixel p in the image

weighted means of all the neighbourhood pixels
are calculated for a NxN filter.

for every neighbour hood pixel q

Weight= e^(-(d(p,q))^2/h^2)

where d(p,q) is the Euclidean weight between p and q using a nxn patch centred respectively at p and q.


The resultant image has much of its AWGN noise elements removed while retaining the image details.
