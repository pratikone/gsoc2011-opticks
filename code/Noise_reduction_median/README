Noise reduction by Median Filter
-----------------------------------------------------------
Reducing noise of salt-n-pepper types by using Median filter

Algorithm
For every pixel in an image,
a 3x3 filter is created with that pixel at center
and its neighbours at respective positions.

Now, median is calculated of the filter
and, new value of P = median

The resultant image has much of its noise elements removed.
